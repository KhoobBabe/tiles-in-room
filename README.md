# tiles-in-room

This program shows how many tiles can be placed in each room in a multiple room house.

1. The program asks the user to enter the number of rooms
2. Then the user names each room to avoid confusion and also enters their area. (this is stored in a list)
3. The user also provides the area of the tile, which is to be laid
4. The program calculates this all information and returns the total number of tiles required for each room and how many will be left
